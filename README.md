In this SQL project I performed an analysis of the Sales performance of two selected stores from the dataset(Store Number 5 and Store Number 8) I utilized advanced SQL queries as well as built a visual dashboard to showcase the analysis. 
The dataset was provided in class and I used Snowflake and Tableau to conduct the analysis.
